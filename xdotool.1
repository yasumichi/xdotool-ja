.IX Item "--window window"
Send keystrokes to a specific window id. You can use \*(L"\s-1WINDOW\s0 \s-1STACK\s0\*(R"
references like \*(L"%1\*(R" and \*(L"%@\*(R" here. If there is a window stack, then \*(L"%1\*(R" is

Type a given keystroke. Examples being \*(L"alt+r\*(R", \*(L"Control_L+J\*(R", \*(L"ctrl+alt+n\*(R",
\&\*(L"BackSpace\*(R".
.Sp
Generally, any valid X Keysym string will work. Multiple keys are separated
by '+'. Aliases exist for \*(L"alt\*(R", \*(L"ctrl\*(R", \*(L"shift\*(R", \*(L"super\*(R", and \*(L"meta\*(R" which
all map to Foo_L, such as Alt_L and Control_L, etc.
.Sp
In cases where your keyboard doesn't actually have the key you want to type,
xdotool will automatically find an unused keycode and use that to type the
key.
.Sp
With respect to \*(L"\s-1COMMAND\s0 \s-1CHAINING\s0\*(R", this command consumes the remainder of
the arguments or until a new xdotool command is seen, because no xdotool
commands are valid keystrokes.
.Sp
Example: Send the keystroke \*(L"F2\*(R"
 xdotool key F2
.Sp
Example: Send 'a' with an accent over it (not on english keyboards, but still
works with xdotool)
 xdotool key Aacute
.Sp
Example: Send ctrl+l and then BackSpace as separate keystrokes:
 xdotool key ctrl+l BackSpace

Send keystrokes to a specific window id. See \*(L"\s-1SENDEVENT\s0 \s-1NOTES\s0\*(R" below. The
default, if no window is given, depends on the window stack. If the window
stack is empty the current window is typed at using \s-1XTEST\s0. Otherwise, the

Delay between keystrokes. Default is 12ms.

Types as if you had typed it. Supports newlines and tabs (\s-1ASCII\s0 newline and
tab). Each keystroke is separated by a delay given by the \fB\-\-delay\fR option.
.Sp
With respect to \*(L"\s-1COMMAND\s0 \s-1CHAINING\s0\*(R", this command consumes the remainder of
the arguments and types them. That is, no commands can chain after 'type'.
.Sp
Example: to type 'Hello world!' you would do:
 xdotool type 'Hello world!'

.IX Header "マウスコマンド"
.IP "\fBmousemove\fR \fI[options]\fR \fIx y \s-1OR\s0 'restore'\fR" 4
.IX Item "mousemove [options] x y OR 'restore'"
Move the mouse to the specific X and Y coordinates on the screen.
.Sp
You can move the mouse to the previous location if you specify 'restore'
instead of an X and Y coordinate. Restoring only works if you have moved
previously in this same command invocation. Further, it does not work with
the \-\-window option.
.Sp
For example, to click the top-left corner of the screen and move the mouse to
the original position before you moved it, use this:
 xdotool mousemove 0 0 click 1 mousemove restore
.RS 4
.IP "\fB\-\-window \s-1WINDOW\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "--window WINDOW"
Specify a window to move relative to. Coordinates 0,0 are at the top left of
the window you choose.
.Sp
\&\*(L"\s-1WINDOW\s0 \s-1STACK\s0\*(R" references are valid here, such as \f(CW%1\fR and %@. Though, using
%@ probably doesn't make sense.
.IP "\fB\-\-screen \s-1SCREEN\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "--screen SCREEN"
Move the mouse to the specified screen to move to. This is only useful if
you have multiple screens and \s-1ARE\s0 \s-1NOT\s0 using Xinerama.
.Sp
The default is the current screen. If you specify \-\-window, the \-\-screen
flag is ignored.
.IP "\fB\-\-polar\fR" 4
.IX Item "--polar"
Use polar coordinates. This makes 'x' an angle (in degrees, 0\-360, etc) and
\&'y' the distance.
.Sp
Rotation starts at 'up' (0 degrees) and rotates clockwise: 90 = right, 180 =
down, 270 = left.
.Sp
The origin defaults to the center of the current screen. If you specify a
\&\-\-window, then the origin is the center of that window.
.IP "\fB\-\-clearmodifiers\fR" 4

.IX Item "--sync"
After sending the mouse move request, wait until the mouse is actually
moved. If no movement is necessary, we will not wait. This is useful for
scripts that depend on actions being completed before moving on.
.Sp
Note: We wait until the mouse moves at all, not necessarily that it actually
reaches your intended destination. Some applications lock the mouse cursor
to certain regions of the screen, so waiting for any movement is better in
the general case than waiting for a specific target.

Send a click, that is, a mousedown followed by mouseup for the given button
with a short delay between the two (currently 12ms).

Specify a window to send a click to. See \*(L"\s-1SENDEVENT\s0 \s-1NOTES\s0\*(R" below for
caveats. Uses the current mouse position when generating the event.

The default, if no window is given, depends on the window stack. If the

For example, if you were to run this command:

The result would be 'a' or 'A' depending on whether or not you were holding
the shift key on your keyboard. Often it is undesirable to have any
modifiers active, so you can tell xdotool to clear any active modifiers.

.SH "SENDEVENT NOTES"
.IX Header "SENDEVENT NOTES"
If you are trying to send key input to a specific window, and it does not
appear to be working, then it's likely your application is ignoring the
events xdotool is generating. This is fairly common.
.PP
Sending keystrokes to a specific window uses a different \s-1API\s0 than simply
typing to the active window. If you specify 'xdotool type \-\-window 12345
hello' xdotool will generate key events and send them directly to window
12345.  However, X11 servers will set a special flag on all events generated
in this way (see XEvent.xany.send_event in X11's manual). Many programs
observe this flag and reject these events.
.PP
It is important to note that for key and mouse events, we only use
XSendEvent when a specific window is targeted. Otherwise, we use
\&\s-1XTEST\s0.
.PP
Some programs can be configured to accept events even if they are generated
by xdotool. Seek the documentation of your application for help.
.PP
Specific application notes (from the author's testing): * Firefox 3 seems to
ignore all input when it does not have focus.  * xterm can be configured
while running with ctrl+leftclick, 'Allow SendEvents' * gnome-terminal
appears to accept generated input by default.
.SH "ウィンドウスタック"
.IX Header "ウィンドウスタック"
Certain commands (search, getactivewindow, getwindowfocus) will find windows
for you. These results generally printed to stdout, but they are also saved
to memory for future use during the lifetime of the xdotool process. See
\&\*(L"\s-1COMMAND\s0 \s-1CHAINING\s0\*(R" for more information.
.PP
The only modifications support for the window stack are to replace it. That
is, two of two sequential searches, only the last one's results will be the
window stack.
.SH "COMMAND CHAINING"
.IX Header "COMMAND CHAINING"
xdotool supports running multiple commands on a single
invocation. Generally, you'll start with a search command (see \s-1WINDOW\s0
\&\s-1STACK\s0) and then perform a set of actions on those results.
.PP
To query the window stack, you can use special notation \*(L"%N\*(R" where N is a
number or the '@' symbol. If \f(CW%N\fR is given, the Nth window will be selected
from the window stack. Generally you will only want the first window or all
windows.  Note that the order of windows in the window stack corresponds to
the window stacking order, i.e. the bottom-most window will be reported
first (see \fIXQueryTree\fR\|(3)). Thus the order of the windows in the window stack
may not be consistent across invocations.
.PP
The notation described above is used as the \*(L"window\*(R" argument for any given
command.
.PP
For example, to resize all xterms to 80x24:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& xdotool search \-\-class xterm \-\- windowsize \-\-usehints %@ 80 24
.Ve
.PP
Resize move the current window:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& xdotool getactivewindow windowmove 0 0
.Ve
.PP
In all cases, the default window argument, if omitted, will default to
\&\*(L"%1\*(R". It is obviously an error if you omit the window argument and the
window stack is empty. If you try to use the window stack and it is empty,
it is also an error.
.PP
To activate the first firefox window found:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& xdotool search \-\-class firefox windowactivate
.Ve
.PP
These would error:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& xdotool windowactivate
\& xdotool windowactivate %1
\& xdotool windowactivate %@
.Ve
.PP
When xdotool exits, the current window stack is lost.
.PP
Additinally, commands that modify the \*(L"\s-1WINDOW\s0 \s-1STACK\s0\*(R" will not print the
results if they are not the last command. For example:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& # Output the active window:
\& % xdotool getactivewindow 
\& 20971533
\&
\& # Output the pid of the active window, but not the active window id:
